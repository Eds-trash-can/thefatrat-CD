This small project is dedicated to producing fan-made TheFatRat CD-labels

## Recreating

Please download inkscape and print from there (higher quality prints)



Just print them out, glue the CD-label on a blank cd, and put together in a empty case.

All files are ment and tested to be printed onto A4 size paper. (for US printers please check yourself if it'll fit)
